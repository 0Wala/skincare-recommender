In an age where skincare is vast and popular, many individuals feel overwhelmed by the multitude of products available. With numerous companies entering the market, it can be confusing to identify what works best for their unique skin types. As a result, people often rely on influencers, follow trends, or choose products based on price rather than compatibility.

To address this challenge, I developed a streamlined skincare recommender app ** Glow Guide**, that provides personalized suggestions based on individual skin types and concerns. By simplifying the product discovery process, the app empowers users to make informed choices for healthier skin. With its intuitive interface, this app is designed to guide both skincare beginners and enthusiasts in finding the right products for their unique needs.
